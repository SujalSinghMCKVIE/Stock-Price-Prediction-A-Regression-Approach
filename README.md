## 📖 Introduction
Stock market prediction is a crucial yet challenging task. This project leverages **Linear Regression and Multiple Linear Regression** to analyze historical stock data and forecast future prices. It aims to enhance predictive accuracy and support better investment decisions.

## 📊 Dataset
- The dataset includes **historical stock prices** with features like:
  - Open, High, Low, Close prices
  - Trading Volume
  - Moving Averages (MA5, MA10, MA20, MA50)
  - Technical indicators like MACD, RSI, Bollinger Bands
- The target variable is the **next day’s closing price**.

## 🔄 Project Workflow
1. **Data Checks & Cleaning** – Handling missing values and anomalies.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Identifying trends, patterns, and feature importance.
3. **Feature Engineering** – Creating new features for improved model performance.
4. **Model Training** – Training and fine-tuning regression models.
5. **Model Evaluation** – Using metrics like R-squared, RMSE, and MAE.
6. **Results Visualization** – Comparing actual vs. predicted stock prices.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
- **Modeling:** Linear Regression, Multiple Linear Regression
